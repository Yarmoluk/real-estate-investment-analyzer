# Chapter 6: Property Management

## Introduction

Real estate investment is often glamorized as passive income, but the reality is that rental properties require active management—tenant screening, maintenance coordination, rent collection, lease enforcement, and conflict resolution. How effectively these operational tasks are handled directly impacts financial performance, property condition, and investor stress levels.

This chapter explores the critical decision between self-management and professional management, outlines systems for effective tenant screening and selection, covers lease agreement essentials, details maintenance and capital expenditure planning, addresses rent collection and vacancy management, and provides frameworks for scaling operations as portfolios grow.

## Self-Management vs. Professional Management

The first decision every landlord faces is whether to manage properties personally or hire professional property management.

### Self-Management

**Advantages:**
- Cost savings (8-10% of gross rent)
- Direct control over tenant selection and property decisions
- Faster response times to tenant needs
- Deeper knowledge of property conditions
- Higher profit margins

**Disadvantages:**
- Time-intensive (10-20 hours/month per property initially)
- 24/7 availability expectations from tenants
- Learning curve on legal compliance
- Emotional involvement in tenant conflicts
- Difficulty scaling beyond 5-10 units

**Best For:**
- Investors with available time
- Local property ownership (within 30-minute drive)
- Small portfolios (1-5 properties)
- Investors wanting hands-on experience
- Cost-conscious investors in cash flow optimization phase

### Professional Management

**Advantages:**
- Time leverage enabling focus on acquisitions
- Professional expertise in legal compliance
- Established vendor networks for repairs
- Scalability without time constraints
- Emotional buffer from tenant issues
- Better systems and processes

**Disadvantages:**
- Cost (8-10% of gross rent plus leasing fees)
- Less direct control
- Variable management quality
- Potential communication gaps
- Reduced profit margins

**Best For:**
- Out-of-state investors
- Full-time professionals with limited bandwidth
- Larger portfolios (5+ properties)
- Investors prioritizing time over marginal cost savings
- Properties in tenant-turnover markets

### Hybrid Approach

Many investors self-manage initially to learn operations, then transition to professional management as portfolios scale. Others use professional management for out-of-state properties while self-managing local holdings.

!!! tip "Management Cost Analysis"
    An $1,800/month rental with 10% management fee costs $2,160/year. If self-management requires 15 hours/month, that's 180 hours/year. At a $12/hour effective rate, many professionals find their time better spent on their primary career or finding the next deal rather than managing properties.

## Tenant Screening

Tenant selection is the highest-leverage decision in property management. Great tenants pay on time, maintain properties, and renew leases. Poor tenants create vacancies, property damage, legal costs, and stress.

### Screening Criteria

**Income Verification:**
- Minimum: Gross monthly income ≥ 3× monthly rent
- Documentation: Pay stubs (2 most recent), bank statements, employment verification
- Alternative income: Social Security, disability, alimony (require documentation)

**Credit History:**
- Minimum credit score: 600-650 (adjust by market)
- Review credit report for: payment history, collections, judgments, bankruptcies
- Red flags: Recent evictions, unpaid utility bills, delinquent accounts

**Rental History:**
- Contact previous 2 landlords (current landlord may provide inflated reference to remove problem tenant)
- Verify: On-time payments, property condition, lease violations, reason for moving
- Minimum rental history: 1-2 years

**Criminal Background:**
- State and county criminal record search
- Sex offender registry check
- Fair Housing compliance: individualized assessment, consideration of crime type/timing, relationship to tenancy

**Employment Verification:**
- Contact employer to confirm position and income
- Length of employment (minimum 6-12 months)
- Stability and likelihood of continued employment

### Screening Process

1. **Pre-qualification** - Phone screen covering income, move-in timeline, pets, smoking
2. **Property showing** - Walk through, answer questions, gauge interest
3. **Application submission** - Collect application fee ($30-50) to cover screening costs
4. **Background and credit check** - Run comprehensive screening report
5. **Reference verification** - Contact landlords and employers
6. **Decision** - Approve, conditional approval, or deny with proper Fair Housing documentation
7. **Lease signing** - Collect security deposit and first month's rent

!!! warning "Fair Housing Compliance"
    Federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability. Many states add protected classes (sexual orientation, source of income, etc.). Apply screening criteria uniformly to all applicants and document decisions.

## Lease Agreements

The lease is the legal contract governing the landlord-tenant relationship. Well-drafted leases protect both parties and minimize disputes.

### Essential Lease Components

**Basic Terms:**
- Parties (landlord/tenant legal names)
- Property address and description
- Lease term (start/end dates)
- Rent amount and due date
- Late fee structure
- Security deposit amount and terms

**Use and Occupancy:**
- Permitted occupants (by name)
- Guest policies
- Subletting restrictions
- Property use restrictions (residential only)

**Tenant Obligations:**
- Rent payment terms and methods
- Utility responsibility
- Property maintenance requirements
- HOA rule compliance
- Renter's insurance requirement

**Landlord Obligations:**
- Habitability standards
- Maintenance responsibilities
- Entry notice requirements (typically 24-48 hours)
- Property inspection schedule

**Policies and Rules:**
- Pet policy (deposit, restrictions, monthly fees)
- Smoking policy
- Parking allocation
- Noise and nuisance restrictions
- Trash and recycling procedures

**Lease Termination:**
- Renewal terms and notice periods
- Early termination conditions and penalties
- Holdover provisions
- Security deposit return process
- Move-out procedures and condition expectations

**Legal Provisions:**
- State and local law compliance
- Severability clause
- Modification procedures
- Attorney fees and costs allocation
- Lead paint disclosure (pre-1978 properties)

### Lease Length Considerations

**12-Month Standard:** Most common, balances tenant stability with flexibility

**Month-to-Month:** Higher turnover risk but greater flexibility; typically commands 10-20% rent premium

**6-Month or 18-Month:** Used to stagger lease expirations across portfolio or avoid winter move-outs in cold climates

!!! tip "State-Specific Forms"
    Use lease forms specific to your state or jurisdiction. Many state realtor associations provide compliant templates. Generic online leases may lack required disclosures or contain unenforceable provisions.

## Maintenance Systems

Effective maintenance systems balance cost control, property preservation, and tenant satisfaction.

### Maintenance Categories

**Emergency Maintenance (24-hour response):**
- No heat in winter / no AC in extreme heat
- Gas leaks
- Major water leaks or plumbing failures
- Electrical hazards
- Security issues (broken locks, door damage)

**Urgent Maintenance (48-hour response):**
- Appliance failures
- Minor plumbing issues
- Pest infestations
- HVAC problems (non-emergency)

**Routine Maintenance (5-7 day response):**
- Minor repairs
- Cosmetic issues
- Non-essential items

**Preventive Maintenance (scheduled):**
- HVAC servicing (2x/year)
- Gutter cleaning (2x/year)
- Smoke detector testing
- Exterior maintenance
- Landscaping

### Vendor Management

**Building Vendor Network:**
- Plumber
- Electrician
- HVAC technician
- Handyman
- Appliance repair
- Locksmith
- Pest control
- Landscaper
- Cleaning service

**Vendor Selection Criteria:**
- Licensed and insured
- Responsive and reliable
- Fair pricing
- Quality workmanship
- Tenant-friendly communication

**Work Order System:**
1. Tenant submits maintenance request (online portal, phone, email)
2. Categorize by urgency
3. Assign to appropriate vendor
4. Schedule and communicate timeline to tenant
5. Vendor completes work and documents with photos
6. Invoice submitted and processed
7. Follow-up with tenant to confirm satisfaction

### Maintenance Reserves

Budget maintenance expenses as percentage of rent:
- **Routine maintenance:** 5-8% of gross rent
- **CapEx reserve:** 5-10% of gross rent
- **Total:** 10-18% of gross rent

Higher percentages for older properties, lower for newer construction.

!!! note "Capital Expenditures vs. Repairs"
    Repairs restore to original condition (deductible in year incurred). CapEx improves or extends life beyond original condition (depreciated over time). Examples: HVAC replacement, roof replacement, major appliances, flooring replacement.

## Rent Collection

Consistent rent collection systems minimize late payments and maintain cash flow.

### Payment Systems

**Online Payment Portals (Recommended):**
- Automated ACH transfers
- Credit/debit card processing
- Scheduled recurring payments
- Automatic late fee assessment
- Payment history tracking
- Popular platforms: Cozy, TurboTenant, Buildium, AppFolio

**Traditional Methods:**
- Check (requires deposit trips)
- Money order (no electronic record)
- Cash (avoid due to documentation issues)

### Late Payment Protocol

**Day 1 (Grace Period):** Many leases provide 5-day grace period
**Day 6:** Assess late fee (typically $50-75 or 5% of rent)
**Day 7:** Send late payment notice
**Day 10:** Personal contact (phone call)
**Day 15:** Issue Pay or Quit notice (formal eviction warning)
**Day 20-30:** File eviction if rent remains unpaid

!!! warning "Consistency Critical"
    Apply late fees and collection procedures uniformly to all tenants. Selective enforcement creates Fair Housing exposure and establishes expectations that late payment is acceptable.

## Vacancy Management

Vacancy is the silent profit killer. Every day a property sits vacant costs daily rent plus turnover expenses.

### Turnover Timeline

**30-45 Days Before Lease End:**
- Send renewal offer with new rent rate
- Negotiate terms if necessary
- Secure lease renewal or begin marketing

**Notice Received (Non-Renewal):**
- Schedule move-out inspection
- Begin marketing property
- Plan turnover work

**Move-Out Day:**
- Conduct move-out inspection with tenant
- Document property condition with photos
- Collect keys and garage openers
- Process security deposit accounting

**Turnover Work (Target 7 days):**
- Deep cleaning
- Repairs and touch-up paint
- Address any deferred maintenance
- Professional photos for marketing

**Marketing (Target 10 days to lease signing):**
- Online listings (Zillow, Apartments.com, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace)
- Property signage
- Showings (scheduled or lockbox)
- Application processing

**Lease Signing to Move-In (5-10 days):**
- Final walkthrough
- Key handoff
- Utility transfers
- First rent collection

**Target Total Vacancy:** 15-25 days

### Vacancy Reduction Strategies

**Proactive Lease Renewal:**
- Contact tenants 60 days before lease end
- Offer renewal incentives if appropriate
- Address tenant concerns promptly

**Competitive Pricing:**
- Price 5-10% below market for 2-3 days to generate showing volume
- Raise to market rate if interest is strong
- Faster lease-up reduces total vacancy cost

**Professional Marketing:**
- High-quality photos
- Detailed descriptions
- Highlight unique features and location amenities
- Respond to inquiries within 1-2 hours

**Streamlined Screening:**
- Quick turnaround on application decisions (24-48 hours)
- Clear communication with applicants
- Pre-qualification to focus on serious candidates

**Property Condition:**
- Well-maintained properties lease faster
- Fresh paint and clean carpets/floors essential
- Curb appeal drives showing requests

## Eviction Process

Evictions are costly, time-consuming, and should be avoided through strong screening. However, they are sometimes necessary.

### When to Evict

- Non-payment of rent beyond cure period
- Lease violations after proper notice (illegal activity, unauthorized occupants, property damage)
- Holdover tenancy (remaining after lease expiration without renewal)

### Eviction Process (General - varies by state)

1. **Proper Notice**
   - Pay or Quit (typically 3-14 days)
   - Cure or Quit (lease violation)
   - Unconditional Quit (serious violations)

2. **File Eviction Lawsuit**
   - Submit complaint to court
   - Pay filing fees ($100-300)
   - Serve tenant with court summons

3. **Court Hearing**
   - Present evidence (lease, payment records, notices)
   - Tenant opportunity to respond
   - Judge issues judgment

4. **Writ of Possession**
   - Sheriff removes tenant if they don't vacate voluntarily
   - Landlord regains possession

**Eviction Costs:**
- Legal fees: $500-2,000
- Lost rent during process: 1-3 months
- Turnover and repairs: $1,000-5,000
- Total: $3,000-10,000 typical

!!! warning "Never Self-Help Evictions"
    Never change locks, shut off utilities, or physically remove tenant property without court order. These "self-help" evictions are illegal in all states and expose landlords to significant liability and damages.

## Scaling Operations

Growing from 1 property to 10+ requires systems to avoid becoming overwhelmed.

### Systematization

**Standard Operating Procedures:**
- Tenant screening checklist
- Lease templates and addendums
- Maintenance vendor list and pricing
- Move-in/move-out inspection forms
- Financial tracking spreadsheets

**Technology Tools:**
- Property management software (Buildium, AppFolio, Rent Manager)
- Accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero)
- Document storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Communication platforms (tenant portals)

### Delegation and Team Building

**Property Manager:** Handles day-to-day tenant interactions and maintenance (8-10% of gross rent)

**Virtual Assistant:** Handles showings coordination, tenant inquiries, administrative tasks ($15-25/hour or per-task)

**Maintenance Coordinator:** Manages vendor relationships and work orders (in-house or through property manager)

**Bookkeeper:** Monthly reconciliation, expense categorization, financial reporting ($100-300/month)

### Growth Stages

**1-5 Properties:** Self-management feasible with good systems
**5-10 Properties:** Hybrid approach or transition to professional management
**10-20 Properties:** Professional management recommended, or full-time self-management becomes viable
**20+ Properties:** Consider hiring in-house property manager or partnering with professional firm

## Summary

Property management directly impacts investment returns, property condition, and investor quality of life. Effective tenant screening prevents most problems before they occur. Well-drafted leases establish clear expectations and legal protections. Systematic maintenance preserves property value and tenant satisfaction. Consistent rent collection and vacancy management optimize cash flow. As portfolios scale, systematization and delegation transform real estate from a job into a business. The final chapter will explore tax strategies and scaling approaches that maximize long-term wealth creation.
