# Chapter 4: Financing Strategies

## Introduction

Leverage is the defining characteristic that separates real estate from most other investments. The ability to control valuable assets with limited capital amplifies returns dramatically—but also magnifies risks. Understanding financing options, their appropriate applications, and their impact on investment returns is essential for maximizing capital efficiency and scaling a portfolio.

This chapter explores the full spectrum of financing strategies available to real estate investors: conventional mortgages, government-backed loans, commercial lending, private capital, creative financing techniques, and the mathematical principles underlying leverage analysis. Each financing method involves trade-offs between cost, availability, flexibility, and risk.

## The Power and Risk of Leverage

Leverage allows investors to control more assets with less capital, amplifying returns on equity.

### Return Amplification Example

Consider a $400,000 property generating $32,000 NOI (8% cap rate):

**All-Cash Purchase:**
- Investment: $400,000
- Annual Return: $32,000
- Cash-on-Cash Return: 8.0%

**Leveraged Purchase (75% LTV at 7% interest):**
- Down Payment: $100,000
- Loan: $300,000
- Annual Debt Service: $23,880 (30-year amortization)
- Cash Flow: $32,000 - $23,880 = $8,120
- Cash-on-Cash Return: 8.12%

While the levered return appears similar, consider appreciation benefits:

After 5 years with 3% annual appreciation:
- Property Value: $463,709
- Remaining Loan Balance: $281,345
- Equity: $182,364

**All-Cash Equity Growth:** $463,709 - $400,000 = $63,709 (15.9% total)
**Leveraged Equity Growth:** $182,364 - $100,000 = $82,364 (82.4% total)

Leverage created 5.2× greater equity growth on the same property with one-fourth the capital invested.

!!! warning "Leverage Risk"
    Leverage amplifies losses as powerfully as gains. If the property declined 10% in value to $360,000, the all-cash investor loses $40,000 (10%), but the leveraged investor loses $58,655 in equity (58.7% of initial investment) after accounting for the unchanged debt balance.

## Conventional Mortgages

Conventional mortgages are loans not guaranteed by government agencies, typically conforming to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines.

### Key Characteristics

**Loan Limits (2025):**
- Single-family: $766,550 (high-cost areas up to $1,149,825)
- 2-unit: $981,500
- 3-unit: $1,186,350
- 4-unit: $1,474,400

**Down Payment Requirements:**
- Primary residence: 3-5% minimum
- Investment property: 15-25% (typically 20-25%)
- Second home: 10% minimum

**Qualification Criteria:**
- Credit score: 620 minimum (680+ for best rates)
- Debt-to-income ratio: Maximum 43-50%
- Documentation: Tax returns, W-2s, bank statements
- Reserves: 2-6 months of mortgage payments in liquid assets

### Advantages

- **Lower interest rates** than alternative financing (typically 0.5-1.5% lower than portfolio/commercial loans)
- **Long amortization** (30 years) maximizes cash flow
- **Fixed rates available** providing payment certainty
- **Non-recourse** (in many states) limiting liability to property value
- **Prepayment flexibility** without penalties

### Disadvantages

- **Loan count limits** (Fannie Mae limit of 10 conventional mortgages)
- **Strict qualification** requiring strong credit and income documentation
- **Property condition requirements** (may not finance heavily distressed properties)
- **Slow process** (30-45 days typical)

### Optimal Use Cases

- Primary residence house hacking (owner-occupied with rental units)
- Stabilized investment properties in good condition
- Investors with W-2 income and strong credit
- First 10 properties in portfolio accumulation phase

!!! tip "Portfolio Loan Exception"
    Once you reach Fannie Mae's 10-loan limit, portfolio lenders (keeping loans on their books rather than selling them) can continue financing additional properties, though typically with higher rates and shorter amortization periods.

## Government-Backed Loans

### FHA Loans (Federal Housing Administration)

**Characteristics:**
- Down payment: 3.5% minimum
- Credit score: 580 minimum (500-579 requires 10% down)
- Loan limits: $498,257 (varies by location)
- Mortgage insurance: Required (0.85% annual premium)
- Property limit: Up to 4 units if owner-occupied

**Advantages:**
- Minimal down payment enabling earlier entry
- Lenient credit requirements
- Assumable by future buyers (at original interest rate)

**Disadvantages:**
- Mortgage insurance increases costs
- Only for owner-occupied properties
- Maximum loan limits exclude many markets
- Property must meet FHA condition standards

**Optimal Strategy:** "House hacking" by purchasing a 2-4 unit property with minimal down payment, occupying one unit while renting others. This allows new investors to enter the market with limited capital while generating offsetting rental income.

### VA Loans (Department of Veterans Affairs)

**Characteristics:**
- Down payment: 0% for eligible veterans
- No mortgage insurance required
- Loan limit: No maximum (lenders may impose limits)
- Funding fee: 2.15-3.3% (waived for disabled veterans)
- Property limit: Up to 4 units if owner-occupied

**Advantages:**
- Zero down payment unmatched by any other program
- No mortgage insurance significantly reduces costs
- Competitive interest rates
- Lenient credit requirements

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited to eligible military service members and veterans
- Funding fee adds upfront cost
- Owner-occupancy requirement limits investment use
- Certificate of Eligibility required

Veterans with VA eligibility should prioritize this program for house hacking opportunities given the unparalleled leverage and cost advantages.

## Commercial Lending

Commercial loans finance properties with 5+ units or are structured based on property cash flow rather than borrower income.

### Key Characteristics

**Loan Terms:**
- Loan-to-value: 70-80%
- Interest rates: Higher than residential (typically SOFR + 2-3%)
- Amortization: 20-25 years
- Term: 5, 7, or 10 years with balloon payment
- Qualification: Based on property DSCR (minimum 1.20-1.25)

**Documentation:**
- Property operating statements (T-12 income statement)
- Rent roll showing tenant details
- Tax returns for property and borrower
- Personal financial statement
- Business plan for value-add properties

### Types of Commercial Loans

**Permanent Financing:**
- Stabilized properties with occupancy >85%
- Fixed or variable rates
- 20-30 year amortization
- Prepayment penalties common (step-down or yield maintenance)

**Bridge Loans:**
- Short-term (1-3 years) for transitional properties
- Higher rates (typically SOFR + 4-6%)
- Interest-only payments
- Used during renovation/stabilization before permanent refinance

**Construction Loans:**
- Ground-up development or major renovation
- Funds disbursed in draws as work completes
- Interest-only during construction
- Higher rates and fees
- Requires detailed construction budget and timeline

### Advantages

- **Unlimited loan count** enabling portfolio scaling
- **Higher loan amounts** financing large properties
- **Income-based qualification** (DSCR) rather than personal income
- **Non-recourse options available** limiting personal liability

### Disadvantages

- **Higher costs** (rates, fees, and prepayment penalties)
- **Shorter terms** requiring periodic refinancing
- **Balloon payments** creating refinance risk
- **More extensive documentation** and due diligence

!!! note "Commercial Transition Point"
    Most investors transition to commercial lending when acquiring properties with 5+ units, accumulating 10+ residential mortgages, or when personal income no longer qualifies for additional residential loans. The shift trades lower rates for greater scalability.

## Hard Money Lending

Hard money lenders provide short-term, asset-based loans secured by real estate.

### Characteristics

**Loan Terms:**
- Loan-to-value: 65-75% of current value or 75-90% of purchase price
- Interest rates: 10-14%
- Points: 2-4 points (percentage of loan amount)
- Term: 6-24 months
- Qualification: Based primarily on asset value and equity
- Approval: Days rather than weeks

### Advantages

- **Speed** closing in days rather than weeks
- **Lenient qualification** focusing on asset rather than credit/income
- **Flexibility** on property condition (finances distressed properties)
- **Creative structures** possible

### Disadvantages

- **High cost** (12-18% all-in cost when including points)
- **Short term** requiring exit strategy (refinance or sale)
- **Lower LTV** requiring more equity down
- **Personal guarantees** typically required

### Optimal Use Cases

- Fix-and-flip projects with <12 month timeline
- Bridge financing while conventional loan processes
- Borrowers with credit issues preventing conventional approval
- Highly distressed properties conventional lenders won't finance
- Time-sensitive opportunities requiring fast closing

!!! warning "Exit Strategy Critical"
    Hard money is expensive and short-term. Always have a clear exit strategy (refinance, sale, or alternative financing) before using hard money. Properties held beyond the term face expensive extension fees or forced sale.

## Private Money Lending

Private money involves borrowing from individuals (friends, family, colleagues, or private investors) rather than institutions.

### Structure Options

**Secured Promissory Note:**
- Borrower signs note promising repayment
- Lender holds mortgage/deed of trust on property
- Terms negotiated between parties
- Interest rates typically 6-12%

**Equity Partnership:**
- Lender provides capital for equity ownership percentage
- Profits and appreciation split per operating agreement
- Common splits: 70/30, 60/40, 50/50
- Investor typically passive; borrower actively manages

### Advantages

- **Flexible terms** negotiated based on relationship
- **Lower costs** than institutional loans
- **Fast closing** with minimal documentation
- **Creative structures** possible
- **Relationship-based** approval

### Disadvantages

- **Relationship risk** mixing business and personal relationships
- **Limited scalability** as individual capital is finite
- **No standardization** requiring custom documentation
- **Potential conflicts** if investment underperforms

### Optimal Use Cases

- First investment when conventional financing unavailable
- Supplementing down payment or rehab budget
- Investors with strong networks but limited capital
- Creative deal structures (seller financing, subject-to)

!!! tip "Protecting Relationships"
    When borrowing from friends or family, treat it more formally than institutional lending. Provide regular updates, detailed documentation, and ensure lenders understand and accept the risks. Relationship preservation is more valuable than any single deal.

## Seller Financing

Seller financing occurs when the property seller extends a loan to the buyer, acting as the lender.

### Structure

**Common Terms:**
- Down payment: 10-30%
- Interest rate: Negotiable (often below market)
- Term: 3-10 years (often with balloon)
- Amortization: 15-30 years
- Monthly payments to seller rather than bank

### Advantages

- **Flexible terms** negotiated directly with seller
- **Easier qualification** as seller sets requirements
- **Faster closing** without lender requirements
- **Potential below-market rates** if seller motivated
- **Creative structures** (wraparound mortgages, contract for deed)

### Disadvantages

- **Seller must own free and clear** or have low loan balance
- **Seller reluctance** to carry paper
- **Due-on-sale risk** if underlying mortgage exists
- **Balloon payments** creating future financing requirement

### Creating Seller Financing Opportunities

Sellers most open to financing:
- Own property free and clear
- Seeking tax-deferred income stream
- Motivated to sell but lacking buyer interest
- Retiring and seeking passive income
- Avoiding capital gains tax spike

**Negotiation Strategy:** Position seller financing as solving seller problems (tax deferral, steady income, faster sale) rather than simply benefiting the buyer.

## Creative Financing Techniques

### Subject-To

Acquiring property "subject to" the existing mortgage means taking ownership while leaving the seller's loan in place.

**Structure:**
- Buyer takes title via deed
- Existing mortgage remains in seller's name
- Buyer makes mortgage payments
- Seller released from liability (negotiated or through formal assumption)

**Advantages:** Minimal cash required; assumable payment terms; speed
**Risks:** Due-on-sale clause; seller credit risk if payments missed; lender acceleration

### Lease Options

Leasing property with option to purchase at predetermined price within specified timeframe.

**Structure:**
- Tenant leases property for 1-3 years
- Option to purchase at set price
- Portion of rent may credit toward purchase
- Option fee (typically 1-5% of price) paid upfront

**Advantages:** Control property with minimal capital; lock in purchase price; generate income during option period
**Disadvantages:** Option fee at risk if purchase doesn't occur; property appreciation limited to option price

## Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios

LTV measures loan size relative to property value, indicating leverage level and risk.

### Formula

```
LTV = (Loan Amount / Property Value) × 100
```

### Typical LTV Requirements

| Loan Type | Maximum LTV |
|-----------|-------------|
| Conventional (owner-occupied) | 95-97% |
| Conventional (investment) | 75-80% |
| FHA (owner-occupied) | 96.5% |
| VA (owner-occupied) | 100% |
| Commercial | 70-80% |
| Hard Money | 65-75% |

**Combined Loan-to-Value (CLTV):** When multiple loans exist (first mortgage + second mortgage or HELOC), CLTV includes all debt.

Lower LTV indicates:
- More borrower equity (skin in the game)
- Less lender risk
- Better loan terms (lower rates)
- Larger cushion against value decline

## Leverage Analysis Framework

When evaluating financing options, analyze:

### Cost Analysis

**All-in Cost of Capital:**
```
Total Cost = Interest Rate + (Points / Years Held) + Closing Costs + Annual Fees
```

Example comparing two loans for a 5-year hold:

| Factor | Conventional | Hard Money |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Interest Rate | 7.0% | 12.0% |
| Points | 0 | 3 points (0.6%/year) |
| Closing Costs | $5,000 ($400/year) | $2,000 ($400/year) |
| **All-in Annual Cost** | **7.4%** | **13.0%** |

### Cash Flow Impact

Calculate cash-on-cash return under different financing scenarios to determine optimal leverage.

### Risk Assessment

- What if NOI declines 20%? Can debt service still be covered?
- What if refinance rates are higher than expected at balloon maturity?
- What if sale takes 6 months longer than projected?

!!! tip "Conservative Underwriting"
    Successful investors underwrite conservatively: assume higher expenses, lower rents, longer vacancy periods, and include contingency reserves. Deals that work under pessimistic assumptions create wealth; deals requiring optimistic projections create losses.

## Summary

Financing strategy profoundly impacts investment returns and risk. Conventional mortgages offer the lowest costs for stabilized properties and creditworthy borrowers. Government-backed FHA and VA loans enable house hacking with minimal capital. Commercial lending scales portfolios beyond residential loan limits. Hard money finances fix-and-flip projects and distressed properties despite high costs. Private money and seller financing offer creative alternatives when conventional paths are unavailable. Optimal financing matches loan characteristics to investment strategy, timeline, property condition, and borrower qualifications. The next chapter explores the BRRRR method, which combines multiple financing strategies to enable infinite returns through capital recycling.
