## B

## D

## E

**Equity** - The difference between a property's market value and outstanding debt. Equity increases through appreciation, mortgage paydown, or additional capital improvements.

## M

**MLS (Multiple Listing Service)** - A database used by real estate professionals to share property listings. Provides the most comprehensive data on available and sold properties.
